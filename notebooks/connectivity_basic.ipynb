In addition to the [`datasets`](https://nilearn.github.io/modules/reference.html#module-nilearn.datasets), [`image`](https://nilearn.github.io/modules/reference.html#module-nilearn.image), and [`plotting`](https://nilearn.github.io/modules/reference.html#module-nilearn.plotting) modules from the first notebook, we discovered here the following modules:\n",
